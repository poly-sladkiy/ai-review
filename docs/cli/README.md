## 💡 Examples

### 🧠 Full Review

Runs the complete review cycle — inline + summary:

```bash
ai-review run
```

### 🧩 Inline Review Only

For quick line-by-line comments:

```bash
ai-review run-inline
```

Typical in CI/CD pipelines for fast feedback on changed files.

### 🧠 Context Review

For broader architectural or cross-file feedback:

```bash
ai-review run-context
```

The model receives the entire diff set and can highlight inconsistencies between modules.

### 🗒️ Summary Review

Posts one concise summary comment under the merge/pull request:

```bash
ai-review run-summary
```

Useful when inline feedback isn’t required but a global analysis is.

### 💬 Reply Modes

Generate AI-based follow-ups to existing discussion threads:

```bash
ai-review run-inline-reply
ai-review run-summary-reply
```

Replies only to comments originally created by AI Review.

### 🧽 Clear Inline Comments

Removes all AI-generated inline comments:

```bash
ai-review clear-inline
```

> ⚠️ **Warning**
>
> This command **permanently deletes** all inline review comments created by AI Review in the current merge / pull
> request.
>
> - The operation cannot be undone
> - Only comments marked with the AI Review inline tag are affected
> - Developer and user comments are not touched
>
> It is recommended to run this command **manually** and only when you are sure that existing AI comments are no longer
> needed.

### 🧽 Clear Summary Comments

Removes all AI-generated summary comments:

```bash
ai-review clear-summary
```

> ⚠️ **Warning**
>
> This command **permanently deletes** all summary review comments created by AI Review.
>
> - The operation cannot be undone
> - Only AI Review summary comments are removed
> - No new comments are created as part of this command
>
> Use with caution, especially in shared or long-running pull requests.

## ⚙️ Tips

- Each command runs **asynchronously** and handles exceptions internally.
- All reviews report **token usage** and **LLM cost** after completion.
- The CLI is designed for **non-interactive** use — perfect for CI/CD jobs.
